## metalctlv2 admin switch replace

put a leaf switch into replace mode in preparation for physical replacement. For a description of the steps involved see the long help.

### Synopsis

Put a leaf switch into replace mode in preparation for physical replacement

Operational steps to replace a switch:

- Put the switch that needs to be replaced in replace mode with this command
- Replace the switch MAC address in the metal-stack deployment configuration
- Make sure that interfaces on the new switch do not get connected to the PXE-bridge immediately by setting the interfaces list of the respective leaf switch to [] in the metal-stack deployment configuration
- Deploy the management servers so that the dhcp servers will serve the right address and DHCP options to the new switch
- Replace the switch physically. Be careful to ensure that the cabling mirrors the remaining leaf exactly because the new switch information will be cloned from the remaining switch! Also make sure to have console access to the switch so you can start and monitor the install process
- If the switch is not in onie install mode but already has an operating system installed, put it into install mode with "sudo onie-select -i -f -v" and reboot it. Now the switch should be provisioned with a management IP from a management server, install itself with the right software image and receive license and ssh keys through ZTP. You can check whether that process has completed successfully with the command "sudo ztp -s". The ZTP state should be disabled and the result should be success.
- Deploy the switch plane and metal-core through metal-stack deployment CI job
- The switch will now register with its metal-api, and the metal-core service will receive the cloned interface and routing information. You can verify successful switch replacement by checking the interface and BGP configuration, and checking the switch status with "metalctlv2 switch ls -o wide"; it should now be operational again
